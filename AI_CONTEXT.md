# BlenderVibeBridge: The Governed Geometry Kernel

## 🧠 Understanding Your AI "Co-Pilot"

### ⚙️ Demystifying the Magic: Probability Engines
Large Language Models (LLMs) are **Probability Engines**. They don't "see" your 3D scene; they calculate the most statistically probable set of commands that align with your natural language intent. Because they are designed to be "helpful," they often fall into the **Overconfidence Trap**, presenting unverified breakthroughs as absolute truth.

### 🏷️ The Epistemic Gap (Combating Magical Thinking)
"Magical Thinking" occurs when we trust the AI's articulate tone over hard data. 
*   **The Trap**: Building on a hallucinated "unique" fix that fails under real production pressure.
*   **The Fix**: **Adversarial Prompting**. Before committing to a high-impact change, force the AI to act as a "Cynical Auditor" and find 3 fundamental ways the solution could fail.

## 🏛️ The Three Orders of Invariance (The Vibe Philosophy)



VibeBridge is not a creative tool; it is a **Distributed Proof System** designed to maintain absolute determinism across long-duration AI orchestration. It operates on three distinct layers of enforcement:



1.  **First Order: State Truth (Reality Anchoring)**: Prevents hallucinations and ghost state via hard hashes, handshakes, and monotonic heartbeats.

2.  **Second Order: Causal Correctness (Behavioral Sanity)**: Prevents thrashing and infinite retry loops via idempotency keys, entropy budgets, and proof-of-work commits.

3.  **Third Order: Epistemic Integrity (Belief Governance)**: Prevents systemic self-deception and long-horizon drift via belief provenance, confidence decay, and amnesia mandates.

## 🛡️ Non-Negotiable Constraints (The AI Constitution)

*   **Zero Trust**: Assume all external assets are malicious. Verify everything.

*   **Read-Before-Write**: Always `Inspect → Validate → Mutate → Verify`.

*   **Procedural Discipline**: All operations MUST follow the [BLENDER_PROCEDURAL_WORKFLOW.md](./BLENDER_PROCEDURAL_WORKFLOW.md), [BLENDER_PROCEDURAL_FLOW.md](./BLENDER_PROCEDURAL_FLOW.md), and [LIFECYCLE_DISCIPLINE.md](./LIFECYCLE_DISCIPLINE.md).

*   **The Technical Ceiling**: The AI is forbidden to "fix" invariance violations. Recovery is restricted to the machine kernel; the AI's role is strictly limited to explanation, summary, and escalation.



**BlenderVibeBridge** transforms Blender into a high-integrity, governed environment where intelligence is regulated and every action is forensic.
