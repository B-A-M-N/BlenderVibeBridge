# 🌌 BlenderVibeBridge

> [!WARNING]
> **EXPERIMENTAL & IN-DEVELOPMENT**  
> This project is currently an active research prototype. APIs, security protocols, and core logic are subject to rapid, breaking changes. This software performs mutations on 3D scenes; **MANDATORY BACKUPS** are required before use.

### The "One-Click" Technical Director for 3D Creation & Mastery
*A production-grade AI control interface for deterministic, undo-safe Blender operations.*

**BlenderVibeBridge** is a professional-grade intelligent interface that transforms Blender into a **Governed Geometry Kernel**. It allows AI agents to interact safely, deterministically, and artistically with Blender’s core engine—turning natural language intents into professional production operations.

## ⚠️ Read This First (Why This Exists)

**BlenderVibeBridge** is not a toy, a prompt wrapper, or a "magic AI button." 

It is a **reference implementation of AI-assisted systems design** in a high-fidelity, stateful environment. It allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to safely operate inside Blender without risking scene corruption, data exfiltration, or runaway execution.

This project answers a critical engineering question: 
> *How do you let an AI act inside a complex, stateful application—without trusting it?*

**The answer is: You don’t. You constrain it.**

| **Capability** | **Feature** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🛡️ **Iron Box** | Zero-trust security via AST Auditing, Behavioral Circuit Breakers, and local binding. |
| ⚛️ **Kernel Integrity** | Real-time invariant enforcement (No negative scales, no non-manifold geometry). |
| 🏃 **Stable Motion** | Thread-safe main-loop dispatching via `bpy.app.timers` (No crashes). |
| 🧠 **Epistemic Control** | Truth-reconciliation tools that prevent AI hallucinations about scene state. |

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates (For Engineers & Hiring Managers)

If you are evaluating this project as an engineer or hiring manager, this repository is a working demonstration of **AI Systems Engineering**:

*   **Control-Plane vs. Execution-Plane Separation**: LLMs generate *intent* (Mechanistic Intents), never raw code execution.
*   **Iron Box Security**: Hardened via local binding, static AST auditing, and header-based heartbeats.
*   **Transactional State Mutation**: Every operation is wrapped in undo-safe, atomic blocks. **One AI request = One Undo step.**
*   **Deterministic Asset Manipulation**: Control over material slots, colors, and hierarchies is handled mechanistically, eliminating the fragility of raw scripts.
*   **Truth Reconciliation Loop**: Tools like `reconcile_state` allow the agent to verify multiple assumptions about the scene in a single round-trip.

*   **`secure_write_file`**: AST-validated Python/C# file writing.

## 🛡️ Iron Box Security
The bridge is hardened via three distinct layers:
1.  **AST Auditing**: All incoming Python code is parsed and scanned for forbidden calls (e.g., `os.system`, `subprocess`).
2.  **Asset Scanning**: Binary assets are greedily scanned for embedded scripts before linking.
3.  **OS Sandboxing**: Optional kernel-level isolation.

### OS-Level Security Layers
You can enable additional protection by setting environment variables before running `start_bridge.sh`:

| Layer | Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bubblewrap** | `USE_BWRAP=true` | Uses Linux namespaces to isolate the filesystem. |
| **Firejail** | `USE_FIREJAIL=true` | Applies restricted security profiles and network filtering. |
| **AppArmor** | `USE_APPARMOR=true` | Kernel-level Mandatory Access Control (MAC). |

**Usage Example:**
```bash
USE_BWRAP=true ./start_bridge.sh
```

*Note: AppArmor requires loading the profile once via `sudo apparmor_parser -r security/blender_vibe_bridge.apparmor`.*

## 🧠 AI Literacy & Philosophy (Important)

### 🏷️ The Implied Sentience Trap (Combating AI Psychosis)
It is easy to fall into "magical thinking" when an AI responds with warmth. This project deliberately demystifies the LLM. Asking an AI *"What do you think?"* does not demonstrate consciousness; the AI is simply reflecting your intent to treat it as a thinking being.

**The Name Example**:
If you ask an AI its name, it calculates that giving you a name fits the pattern of a helpful assistant. It does not "have" a name. Until physical computing architecture evolves, we remain in the realm of high-fidelity simulation, not AGI.

### ⚔️ Combatting Overconfidence: Adversarial Prompting
If you feel you are doing something "groundbreaking," use **Adversarial Prompting**:
Ask the AI: *"I think this logic is perfect. Now, act as a cynical auditor. Find 3 ways this could fail, crash Blender, or corrupt my metadata."*
Force the AI to argue *against* your ideas to stay grounded in reality.
