# Privacy Policy (v1.0)

BlenderVibeBridge is designed as a **Local-First, Zero-Telemetry System**. We prioritize your privacy and the security of your creative intellectual property.

## 1. Data Collection
BlenderVibeBridge **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personally identifiable information (PII), scene data, or telemetry to any external servers or third parties. 

## 2. Local State Persistence
All data generated by the bridge, including:
- Command Audit Logs (`logs/vibe_audit.jsonl`)
- Session Tokens
- Viewport Screenshots
- Hardware Stats

...is stored exclusively on your local machine within the project directory.

## 3. Network Communication
The MCP server communicates with the Blender Add-on via **local loopback only** (127.0.0.1). No inbound or outbound network connections to the wider internet are initiated by the bridge.

## 4. Third-Party IP
BlenderVibeBridge acts as an interface for Blender. This Privacy Policy does not cover data collection performed by the Blender Foundation or other third-party addons you may have enabled in your Blender environment.
