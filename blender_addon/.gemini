# BLENDER GLOBAL DIRECTIVES

Blender operates under a modal, event-driven system. It is a controlled runtime, not an ad-hoc scripting environment.

**RULES:**
- Do NOT assume linear execution.
- Blocking calls CAN and WILL freeze the UI.
- Context (`bpy.context`) is volatile and state-dependent.
- Operators may fail silently depending on viewport or mode state.
- Stability and Flow integrity outrank convenience.

**REFERENCE:**
- Follow the [BLENDER_FLOW.md](../BLENDER_FLOW.md) for all IPC and lifecycle logic.
