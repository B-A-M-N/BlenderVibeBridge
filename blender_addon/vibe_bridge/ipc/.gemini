# IPC FLOW CONSTRAINTS

This layer handles the low-level communication between Blender and the Bridge Server.

**RULES:**
- **Adversarial Pre-flight**: You MUST call `run_adversarial_preflight` as your first action in any new session to verify bridge stability.
- All I/O must be non-blocking or managed via `bpy.app.timers`.
- The Blender UI MUST remain responsive during all network operations.
- Do NOT introduce busy loops or synchronous waits for server responses.
- Disconnects are an expected part of the lifecycle; implement graceful reconnection.

**REFERENCE:**
- Handshake and connection state rules are defined in [BLENDER_FLOW.md](../../../BLENDER_FLOW.md).
