# OPERATOR DISCIPLINE

This layer contains the `bpy.types.Operator` implementations for the bridge.

**RULES:**
- Operators are highly context-dependent. Do NOT assume an active object or area.
- Prefer direct data API (`bpy.data`) over operators (`bpy.ops`) wherever possible for stability.
- Operator failures must be caught and logged; they MUST NOT crash the bridge addon.
- All mutations must be undo-safe and transaction-wrapped.

**REFERENCE:**
- Transaction and execution rules are in [BLENDER_FLOW.md](../../../BLENDER_FLOW.md).
