# BLENDER ADDON & BRIDGE IDENTITY

This directory contains the VibeBridge addon. It functions as a networked client in a synchronized system.

**RULES:**
- **Adversarial Pre-flight**: You MUST call `run_adversarial_preflight` as your first action in any new session to verify bridge stability.
- `register()` and `unregister()` MUST be perfectly symmetric.
- Persistent handlers MUST be explicitly removable to prevent leaks.
- Do NOT refactor networking or IPC logic without specific instructions.
- Message formats are contractual; any change requires a schema version update.
- Graceful recovery from external server restarts is mandatory.

**REFERENCE:**
- Adhere to the [BLENDER_FLOW.md](../../BLENDER_FLOW.md) for synchronization contracts.
