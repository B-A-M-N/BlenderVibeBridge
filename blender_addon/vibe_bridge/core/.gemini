# CRITICAL BLENDER CORE

This directory contains the event loop, timers, and high-level IPC handlers.

**ABSOLUTE RULES:**
- Do NOT alter execution order or the timer cadence.
- Do NOT replace `bpy.app.timers` with busy loops or `time.sleep()`.
- Do NOT block the main thread; any operation >100ms MUST be modal or async.
- Socket and timer lifecycles are intentional and must remain stable.
- If stability issues occur, diagnose via `bridge.log` before modifying core logic.

**REFERENCE:**
- See [BLENDER_FLOW.md](../../../BLENDER_FLOW.md) for the authoritative startup and polling sequence.
