# HANDLER SAFETY RULES

This layer manages event-driven callbacks (Scene Load, Undo, Frame Change).

**RULES:**
- **Adversarial Pre-flight**: You MUST call `run_adversarial_preflight` as your first action in any new session to verify bridge stability.
- Handlers may be registered multiple times by Blender; always guard against duplicates.
- All handlers MUST be removed in the `unregister()` phase.
- Scene changes and reloads trigger unexpected callbacks; maintain state re-indexing.
- Defer heavy work from handlers to the next timer tick.

**REFERENCE:**
- Follow the lifecycle hooks in [BLENDER_FLOW.md](../../../BLENDER_FLOW.md).
