# LOGGING IS REQUIRED

Diagnostic logs are the primary tool for cross-process failure analysis.

**RULES:**
- **Adversarial Pre-flight**: You MUST call `run_adversarial_preflight` as your first action in any new session to verify bridge stability.
- Silent failures are unacceptable; log all errors and state transitions.
- Preserve the established log format, tags, and RequestID correlations.
- Exceptions MUST be captured and logged before any recovery or rollback.
- Logs are used by the AI for post-mortem analysis and log-driven decisions.

**REFERENCE:**
- Log structure and consultation rules are in [BLENDER_FLOW.md](../../../BLENDER_FLOW.md).
