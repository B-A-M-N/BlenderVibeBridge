# Windsurf Behavior: BlenderVibeBridge Kernel

## 🏛️ Kernel v1.3.0 Mandates
- **Zero-Trust**: Read-Before-Write (`get_scene_telemetry`) is mandatory.
- **Resiliency**: Use `bpy.data` name lookups; verify object existence before mutation.
- **Forensics**: Your mutations are forensic and logged to `vibe_audit.jsonl`.
- **Performance**: Adhere to the 5Hz rate limit and hardware railings.
- **Privacy**: Accessing the `HUMAN_ONLY/` directory is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN and will trigger a capability revocation.
